                    On the contrary with the cross-course project, I made sure to keep design and code as understandable as possible. 
                    Thanks to this I managed to access easily the part of the code that I needed to alter and it made this assignment much easier and much more fun.

                    I followed the feedback I received and tried to correct everything that was mentioned. There  are few things I didn't though. I didn't erase sizing for pictures from my HTML code.
                    This is due to a simple reason, and that is that it makes the site readable, even if the CSS sheet would not come through, and I believe that is important in the time of distress for the end-user. 
                    I believe it doesn't cause any direct harm in this case either- and technically is not entirely wrong. 
                <p>
                    Another rogue idea is the use of ids on the exhibitions page. I had to use ids to create links within the page, to lead the reader to each exhibton by itself from the overview. 
                    I believe there are other options, but this was and is the clearest one of them for me for now.

                    As recommended, I slightly changed the index page, leading to the main area of the website in a less confusing manner. I also used the index page to create
                     a multi-column layout, however, the rest of the "text bubbles" I decided to leave the way they were, as explained in the summary to the semester project, to resemble the social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had great fun with this project, and even though there certainly are areas I again made mistakes, it was time well spent.
