                <p>
                    This project was our first larger one, and it has brought me many sleepless nights, both during and after finishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a chaotic example of how not to write code. Several attempts later, I still can't untangle all the thoughts behind this code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The possible solution to this is to start all over and create a new page, which I have not managed in this assignment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we passed courses, I added accordingly to this project. Sadly, the most recent addition with API calls has not worked entirely for me, as I couldn't load in choices and "add to basket" button.
                    So as for the flow of the page, the most recent version is not the most fluent one. I still lack the knowledge of connecting the back-end structure that wordpress was offering with my front-end product. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is, however, still certain progress in comparison to the original website - and I feel I learned a lot from this project.
